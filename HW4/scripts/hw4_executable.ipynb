    "\n",
    "Convexity adjustments are LARGER for further out contracts, growing from 0.000003% (nearest) to 0.00075% (furthest). But even at 4 years, the maximum adjustment is only 0.075bps - still negligible.\n",

    "= 0.00075\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since sigma appears squared, even doubling σ from 70 bps to 140 bps only quadruples an already negligible adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observation 2: Sigma Is Poorly Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "Because convexity adjustments are negligible, the SSE function is nearly flat across sigma values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- σ = 10 bps  → SSE ≈ 0.005  \n",
    "- σ = 70 bps  → SSE ≈ 0.005  \n",
    "- σ = 100 bps → SSE ≈ 0.005  \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimizer pushes sigma to the upper bound of its search range because larger sigma marginally reduces positive errors, but never reaches zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** σ is not well-identified from 4-year swap data alone.  \n",
    "Longer maturities (10Y, 30Y) would be needed to meaningfully calibrate σ.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observation 3: Residual Errors Come From Stub Period Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistent ~1.5 bp overestimation of par rates across all maturities is attributable to the stub period approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stub Period:** Dec 1 → Dec 17 (16 days)  \n",
    "- **Used:** 3.705% (first SOFR futures rate)  \n",
    "- **Should use:** actual overnight SOFR on Dec 1  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the futures rate as a proxy introduces a small but systematic bias that cannot be corrected by adjusting σ.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source of Error | Magnitude | Can σ Fix It? |\n",
    "|----------------|----------:|:-------------:|\n",

    "| Stub period approximation | ~1.5 bps | No |\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For short-dated curves (≤ 4 years), convexity adjustments are negligible.  \n",
    "The residual pricing errors of ~1.5 bps are primarily attributable to the stub period approximation (using futures rate as proxy for actual overnight SOFR), not convexity adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaningful calibration of σ from this data alone is not possible due to the flat SSE landscape.\n"
